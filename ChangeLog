Version 0.98.3 20.Dec.2002

pasi:

- sections in mission files, so from now on it should be
  possible to keep missions backward compatible.
  (text-format towers are still without this)
- dynamically allocated highscore list.
- highscore list also saves the tower reached.
  (-1 means the player played the mission through)
- highscore list doesn't show the pages with all scores
  0 and no names.
- bugfix: toggling alpha options doesn't change
  the star positions now.
- bugfix: the level editor key help showed the title
  screen background if you went to the key help right
  after entering the editor.
- debugging level: output via debugprintf(),
  debug level can be set on the command line. (-d option)
- updated the man-page to have the -d parameter,
  and some other small changes in it.
- level editor keys can now have modifiers:
  shift, control and/or alt.
- new type of tower block: step that slides to right.
  works like the slider left, exactly
- added "Put slider right" to the level editor keys,
  bound to shift+x.
- readded "Decrease time" to the level editor keys,
  bound to shift+n.
- level editor shows key, key modifier and action on
  the console if debug_level >= 4.
- in toppler.spec.in lowered the BuildRequires SDL-devel
  version from 1.2.4 down to 1.2.2.
  (I use that SDL version to compile, so i guess it works ;)
  [That is, if i'm guessing correctly what BuildRequires means...]
  
me:

- bugfix for big endian systemy
- some speed improvements (thanks to Aurel Schwarzentruber)
- lots of typos were fixed, some function names were renamed to better
  enlish names
- small updates to documentation
- h and F1 activate helpscreen in leveleditor
- one more type of water
- now it's possible to have different lenght robot animations
- sections in tower files, this breaks compatibility hopefully for the
  last time
- each tower can have a selectable robot

Version 0.98.2

-when user selects "Quit game" from the game menu during
 game, do not show hiscores after that, but go directly
 back to main menu.

-Bugfix: In level editor, if you loaded a tower which was shorter
 the cursor stayed higher than the new tower's top.

-In text input routine, if a low-case letter is allowed but
 not high-case, and user enters high-case letter, convert
 the letter to low-case. And vice versa.

-you can now define justification better for menu options:
 left justify, right justify, or centered.
 (MOF_LEFT, MOF_RIGHT)

-if we have alpha for sprites on, use that instead of
 blinking the vanishing steps in the level editor.

-in level editor, added 2 new commands: cut and paste row(s).

-level editor tower start height and page up/down movement size
 are saved to config file.

-key redefinitions are saved to config file.

-Bugfix: when game was waiting in some loops,
 killing wasn't effective. (no checking of quit_action)
 (leveledit.cc: tower color changer and key help,
  game.cc: bonus(), keyb.cc: wait_for_focus())

-Use UNICODE to get input for input fields; this
 is toggleable in the config file, as it causes a
 bit of an overhead. If this is on, the keyboard works
 more like expected in men_input(), eg. shifted keys work.
 There's lots more characters missing from the char set
 grpahics, eg. @, -, which should be available...

-changed men_input() to nonblocking function.

-in level editor, in tower color changer, you can now
 press '.' to randomize the colors.

-generalized textsystem, similar to menu system.
 level editor key help uses the textsystem.

-level editor: new command: adjust tower height.
 it asks for an input, and depending on what you give,
 changes the tower height:
   100 => set tower height to 100
   -50 => shorten the tower by 50,
   +25 => make tower 25 lines taller.

 NOTE: there's no minus in the character set graphics!!

-you can now select how many lives you have when starting the
 game; 1-3 lives.

-tower passwords; you can enter a password in the menu, and
 then start a game. The passwords are calculated from the
 tower[][] -array. (see gen_passwd() in level.cc)
 The game shows the password every 3rd tower,
 unless it's the first or last tower of the mission.
 The last entered password is saved to config file.
 (see level.cc: gen_passwd(), lev_get_passwd(), lev_show_passwd(),
  lev_tower_passwd_entry())

-added a new level editor command: goto end. it finds the target
 door, and moves cursor there.

-level editor background screen is now darkened when the editor
 waits for input or shows some informational text on the screen.

-3 new text formatting commands for scr_writeformattext():
 ~T###  - same as ~t, but relative to x, instead of screen edge.
 ~b#    - show a tower block.
 ~e#    - show a tower block in level editor style.

-added a new function scr_formattextlength(), that returns
 the length of formatted text.
 (Needed to make the level editor key help work with the
 generalized text system as previously)


Version 0.98.1 24.11.2002

- Added a new config option "status_top"; this tells whether
  the status line is on top or bottom of screen.
  Currently this option is not in the menus. (OK, so this is
  a new feature =)
  
- Fixed some typos.
  
- Don't play alarm-sound if time < 0
  (This should never happen, but just in case...)
  
- Fixed a bug that made mouse clicks not activate menu options.
  I noticed this one too =)
  
- Changed the key definitions from #defines to enum ttkey.
  
- Allow setting menu option centering individually for each menu option.
   |
   V
- Key redefinition menu now looks slightly better; the options
  do not move around.
  
- Hiscore-screen now shows the mission name.
  
- In hiscore screen, doubled the empty spaces between
  rank, score and playername, and added '.' to the
  rank number.
  
- Fixed a bug in the menu system, which allowed highlighting
  illegal options, with no text.
  
- Use enum for towerblocks, instead of hardwired bitmask values.
  (Now we have lots of room for new blocks!)
  You need to remake the missions.
  
- Fixed a bug in the config parser, which would cause strange crashes,
  if any string variable ('editor_towername') had empty string as param.
  (This is the bug that caused TT to crash when the 2nd satellite tried
   to come on screen)
  
- Config file parser now also accepts "yes" or "true"
  for boolean values.
  
- Config parser is now more tolerant of malformed config file, and
  fscanf() cannot overrun the char buffers.
  
- Fixed 2 bugs in main_game_loop():
  1) Don't try to load a tower for bonusgame after the last tower
     in a mission is finished.
  2) End mission when the last tower is finished, instead of
     after 8 towers.
  
- Fixed a bug in the bonus game that prevented the next tower color
  being set.
  
- Fixed the line input routine to work with the variable width font
  by showing arrows at the end of the input area if the string is
  longer than what can be seen.
  
- When the window loses focus, darken the window, and wait, giving
  timeslices away, until it regains focus.

me

- enclose debug settings inside TESTER compiler variable to prevent
  ever releasing a version with falst setings again
- added arrows to the left and right of the start menu entry to show
  what to do
- levels contain priority that orders them
- workaround for SDL RLEAccel bug


Version 0.98.0 18.11.2002

pasi

- max. # of characters in the charset changed to 128.
- changed fonttoppler and fontpoint to be in the
  unprintable range. (frees '#' and '\')
- lev_is_consistent() returns 3 new errors: not enough time,
  tower is too short, and tower has no name.
  (these have the lowest priority)
- the new tower in level editor begins 4 rows taller
  (minimum legal height), and the time starts somewhere
  around 100 - 600.
- fixed a bug where the game would hang, if the hero
  reached the target door, and the door was on the 2nd
  row from bottom of the tower.
- toppler now dies gracefully, both with "kill" or
  from window manager "close window" -button click.
- you can now navigate the menus with mouse.
  (and depending whether you have the 4th and 5th button
  set as the wheel on wheelmouse, you'll be able to use that too)
- in fullscreen mode, mouse is disabled and becomes hidden.
- fixed a bug in level editor: not enough of the tower-array
  was cleared when starting the editor.
- very colorful highlight-bar, that moves in increments, instead
  of warping from one option to another.
- level editor: added a way to enter the tower time directly.
- level editor: input lines now show a text of what they ask.
- level editor: tweaked the colors in the tower color changer.
- commented out scaling-option from options -menu.
- you can now redefine keys, "redefine keys" option in
  the options-menu.
- fixed typos, mainly in comments.
- toppler.dat can now contain any number of files,
- changed archi.cc to have the same length file name
  in the fileindex as in the other diff. (8.3 filenames)
- added GAME_DEBUG_KEYS define to decl.h. If you
  define that, you can press up+down+left+right
  during game and get a debug menu. Hiscores are
  not saved if this is defined.
- changed data file names to have the '.dat' suffix
  in decl.h.
- editor now doesn't display the tower time during
  some operations. (eg. during key help)
- editor key help and menu quick keys now use SDL keysyms
  instead of chars.
- player lives are now shown on the upper right corner,
  and if player has more than 3 lives, they're shown
  in a 'short' format.
- screen.cc: bonus game now supports more than 3 scrolling
  layers, and loading the layer speeds (and the tower speed
  and layering depth) from toppler.dat. I haven't tested this
  much, but at least the current setup works.
- moved some hardwired constants from bonus game to decl.h
- stars.cc: made the max. # of stars dynamic.

- switched to double resolution graphics and replaced all the
  graphics with new ones
- alpha blended sprites
